# Overview
Exploration into Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) focuses on the visualization of deep features, attention maps, and the development of adversarial patterns to examine Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) robustness, leveraging the pre-trained VGG11 CNN model.

This study involves several key tasks: 
- Calculating L2 norms across feature map activation channels 
- Using gradient calculations to visualize where the network focuses its attention
- Crafting targeted adversarial attacks to test how easily the network can be "fooled"
